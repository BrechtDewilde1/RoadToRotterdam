# Story 
My girlfriend and I wanted to spice up the boring pandemic period. Therefore we decided to participate in the marathon of Rotterdam! 
Training for a marathon is intensive and takes a lot of time. Therefore I created this dashboard to stay motivated during the 19 week trainings schedule.

The dashboard visualizes our progress and intesting training statistics. It also has a map that indicates all the roads we have been running on. 

# Techology
The site runs on a python flask server hosted by [pythonanywhere](http://www.pythonanywhere.com). The data is pulled in by the use of the Strava API. 
Data processing and map visualization is coded in python. The json and css code comes a freely available [sample](https://www.creative-tim.com/). 

# Dashboard Layout
Most of the CSS code is taken from
[Argon Dashboard Flask](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard-flask) - Provided by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) and [AppSeed](https://appseed.us)
